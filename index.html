            <p> Born on August 31, 2019 (approximately)
            <br>
            <br>
            Luna was found alone in a field near the humane society she ended up at. The Humane society treated her for a respiratory infection and Synechia of her left eye. Synechia is an eye condition where the iris and pupil fuse. It is why her left eye is a bit different in color and pupil shape. Vets that have looked at Luna say that it may of been caused by trauma or the respiratory infection. She should be able to see out of the eye for the most part but may have worse vision then her other eye.

            <p>Adopted on November 20, 2019 by Allie Vilasi</p>
            <br>
            <p>Luna quickly adjusted to her new enviroment and family. She is a very loving cat but definitely has some attitude. She loves playing and may even try to hunt you. After she has her fun she loves to cuddle up and nap with her human Allie. She has many designated spots to sleep all throughout the house. You may find her sleeping on a pile of bags under the sink or high up in her cat tree watching over the land.</p>

            <p>If you would like to adopt a pet I would highly recommend looking for a Humane Society or animal shelter local to you. There are so many animals that don't get adopted that would love to be in a forever home. If you don't want a pet you could always make a donation to a local animal shelter or Humane Society. They need constant donations to help provide care for as many animals as they can Please find more info by going to the Humane Society website here: <a href="https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Animal Humane Society</a> </p>
