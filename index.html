            Luna was found alone in a field near the humane society she ended up at. The Humane society treated her for a respiratory infection and Synechia of her left eye. Synechia is an eye condition where the iris and pupil fuse. It is why her left eye is a bit different in color and pupil shape. Vets that have looked at Luna say that it may of been caused by trauma or the respiratory infection. She should be able to see out of the eye for the most part but may have worse vision then her other eye.
